# Azure Admin UI Deployment Folder

This folder contains the Azure-specific build output and configuration for the Admin UI.

## Contents:
- `dist/` - Built React app for Azure deployment (generated during CI/CD)
- `web.config` - IIS configuration for Azure App Service
- `.gitkeep` - Keeps this folder in git (dist/ is gitignored)

## Deployment:
The GitHub Actions workflow builds the admin UI and outputs to `azure-admin/dist/`, then deploys this folder to Azure App Service.
